    <h1>Capstone One Proposal</h1>
        <h2>CalcTube</h2>
        <p>
            In the United States, the most advanced math course a normal high
            school student can take is calculus. Not only does calculus require
            mastery of prior classes such as algebra, it also demands strong
            critical thinking skills, 3D reasoning skills, and the ability to
            reason with infinity, just to name a few skills that students
            have a hard time grasping. On top of that, passing the AP exam,
            which is the goal of a lot of students, is another beast altogether.
            Students are usually under-prepared for the logical connections they
            have to make to do well on the exam. These factors make calculus
            dreaded by many students.

            While there are plenty of resources online, it is often difficult to
            comb through all of the content to find the material that is just
            right. Setting aside the educational quality of the videos, the
            videos can be too dry for some students to focus on, too in-depth
            for a struggling student, or too surface-level for a student who
            wants to kick it up a notch.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of this project is to make a database of YouTube videos
            where students and educators can nominate and vote on videos for each
            topic in the AP calculus standard. This method of user-curation has
            been proven to work as websites such as Reddit have demonstrated.
            This project aims to take the concept further as suited in the
            context of education. Instead of only being able to upvote or
            downvote a video, there are three metrics to be voted on: best
            basics, best in-depth, and most engaging.
        </p>

            There are multiple advantages for using this instead of other
            platforms:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The different voting categories help students and teachers find
                a video that suit their specific need.
            </li>
            <li>
                With the site being modulated into different topics, students can
                study for specific areas that they struggle in.
            </li>
            <li>
                The College Board standards are provided on the page as to help
                the students know if they have learned all they needed for the
                topic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since the website is dedicated to educational content, students 
                are less likely to be distracted.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If this project proves to be successful, the same template can be
            for other subjects such as history, languages, or various disciplines
            of science. It can also be applied to exams such as the SAT, ACT, or
            GRE.
